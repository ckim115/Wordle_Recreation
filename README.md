## Game Proposal ##

Wordle Easy is a word guessing game based off of the game Wordle owned by New York Times. The goal of the game is to guess a random 5 letter word that is generated by the game. The user gets 6 tries to guess the word. The difference between Wordle Easy and Wordle is that each word in the list of words has only unique letters (no repeat letters). For example "BRAIN" is in the list but "CIVIL" is not because "CIVIL" has 2 I's. 

Game Controls:

Typing words
Entering Words

Game Elements:

Letter blocks of 3 different colors
A viewable grid where the game is played

How to Win:

Guess the correct word in less than 6 tries
